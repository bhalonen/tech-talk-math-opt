Mathematical optimization is a programming technique that turns problems in to simple mathematical expressions, then allows a prebuilt solver to attempt to find the best (or constraint obeying) solution.

Math optimization makes sense when you have many (thousands potentially) simple components working together.


This demo will be done in a Jupyter notebook in julia.
